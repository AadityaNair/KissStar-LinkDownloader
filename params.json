Login to Kissanime using your account (make one if needed) \r\n\r\n##2. Press F12 and click on the console tab \r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://a.pomf.se/sndhdw.png)\r\n\r\n##3. Paste the following into the console window and press enter \r\n\r\n    $.getScript(\"https://rawgit.com/ParthKolekar/Kissanime-LinkDownload/master/kissanime.js\");\r\n\r\n##4. Wait till all links are generated, and then copy them from the console window! \r\n\r\nOnce you copy these links you can paste them on your terminal and start downloading.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
